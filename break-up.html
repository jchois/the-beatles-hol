            <span class="text-justify home-text"><strong>Why Did The Beatles Break Up?</strong></span><br><br>
            <p class="text-justify home-text">
                No other band in history has had as great of an influence on the culture as the Beatles. The English super-group rocked the charts, music halls, 
                and an entire generation of the sixties. And then, as quick as they had emerged- they were gone. <br><br>
                The band broke up in 1970, and the music scene was never the same. But was caused the break-up? It turns out a number of things contributed to their 
                downfall. This is what we know about why The Beatles broke-up. 
            </p> <br><br>
            <span class="text-justify home-text"><strong>Difficulty in collaboration</strong></span><br><br>
            <p class="text-justify home-text">
                After the band had stopped touring in August 1966, each of the members began to pursue his own musical tastes to varying degrees. When the group convened 
                to record Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band in November 1966, there was still a camaraderie and desire to collaborate as musicians; however, their 
                individual differences were becoming more apparent. To a greater extent than the others, McCartney maintained a deep interest in the pop musical trends and 
                styles emerging both in Britain and the United States, whereas Harrison developed an interest in Indian music, and Lennon's compositions became more 
                introspective and experimental. Consequently, McCartney began to assume the role of the initiator and leader of the artistic projects of the Beatles. <br><br>

                </span> <br>
                Each band member began to develop individual artistic agendas, which eventually compromised the enthusiasm in the group, and soon each band member became impatient 
                with the others. This became most evident on The Beatles, in which personal artistic preferences began to dominate the recording sessions, which in turn further 
                undermined the band's unity.

            <span class="text-justify home-text"><strong>Fans blamed Yoko Ono for The Beatles break-up</strong></span><br><br>
            <p class="text-justify home-text">
                Towards the end of the Beatle’s work together, Lennon began a relationship with Yoko Ono. He began spending all of his time with her, including in the studio, 
                which irritated other members of the group. Lennon worked with Ono on artistic collaborations, leaving his responsibilities with the band behind. To make matters 
                worse, when disagreements arose between band members, Lennon would stay quiet and instead defer to whatever Ono thought about the situation. <br><br>
                <span class="d-flex flex-column align-items-center">
                    <img width="40%" src="https://i.imgur.com/T9PUUiV.jpg">
                    <span><em>Lennon's wife Yoko Ono, March 1969</em></span>
                </span> <br>
                According to Rolling Stone, when band members objected to Ono being in attendance at every Beatles gathering, Lennon said: “Yoko only wants to be accepted. She wants 
                to be one of us.” Starr replied: “She’s not a Beatle, John, and she never will be.” But Lennon didn’t agree: “Yoko is part of me now. We’re John and Yoko, we’re together.” <br><br>
                
                Fans have always thought Ono had played a role in the band’s break-up, and she was treated with abuse because of it. She was called, “Jap,” “Chink” and “Yellow” in public. 
                Lennon had to defend her, sometimes physically, from the attacks. <br><br>

                In reality, no one person was responsible for the break-up of the Beatles. It was a culmination of many different reasons and rising tensions between band members that eventually 
                led to their separation. Fans mourned the break-up, but we will always have their songs, recorded to share with future generations for as long as we still enjoy it.
