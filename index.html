            The Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960. With a line-up comprising John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, 
            they are often regarded as the most influential band of all time. The group were integral to the evolution of popular music as an art form and to the development 
            of the counterculture of the 1960s.

            Rooted in skiffle, beat and 1950s rock and roll, their sound incorporated elements of classical music and traditional pop in 
            innovative ways, and they later explored music styles ranging from ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock. They also pioneered recording techniques, 
            advanced new methods of artistic presentation, and were commonly viewed as emblems of the era's sociocultural movements.

            Led by the band's primary songwriters, Lennon and McCartney, the Beatles built their reputation playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg 
            over a three-year period from 1960, initially with Stuart Sutcliffe playing bass. The core trio of Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, who 
            had been together since 1958, went through a succession of drummers, including Pete Best, before asking Starr to join them in 1962. Manager 
            Brian Epstein moulded them into a professional act, and producer George Martin guided and developed their recordings, greatly expanding their 
            domestic success after their first hit, "Love Me Do", in late 1962. As their popularity grew into the intense fan frenzy dubbed "Beatlemania", 
            the band acquired the nickname "the Fab Four", with Epstein, Martin and other members of the band's entourage sometimes given the informal title 
            of "fifth Beatle".

              By early 1964, the Beatles were international stars, leading the "British Invasion" of the United States pop market and breaking numerous sales 
              records. They soon made their film debut with A Hard Day's Night (1964). From 1965 onwards, they produced increasingly innovative recordings, including 
              the albums Rubber Soul (1965), Revolver (1966) and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967), and enjoyed further commercial success with The Beatles 
              (also known as the "White Album", 1968) and Abbey Road (1969). <br><br> In 1968, they founded Apple Corps, a multi-armed multimedia corporation that continues to oversee 
              projects related to the band's legacy. After the group's break-up in 1970, all four members enjoyed success as solo artists. Lennon was shot and killed in December 
              1980, and Harrison died of lung cancer in November 2001. McCartney and Starr remain musically active.

              The Beatles are the best-selling music artist in history, with certified sales of over 183 million units in the US and estimated sales of over 
              800 million physical and digital albums worldwide. They hold the record for most number-one albums on the UK Albums Chart, most number-one hits 
              on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and most singles sold in the UK. The group were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1988, and all four 
              main members were inducted individually between 1994 and 2015. In 2008, the group topped Billboard's list of the all-time most successful artists on 
              the Billboard Hot 100. The band have received seven Grammy Awards, four Brit Awards, an Academy Award (for Best Original Song Score for the 1970 film 
              Let It Be) and fifteen Ivor Novello Awards. They were collectively included in Time magazine's compilation of the "Most Important People of the Century".
